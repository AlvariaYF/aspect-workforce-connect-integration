This Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner Solution deploys https://www.alvaria.com/products/workforce-engagement-management/call-center-workforce-management[Alvaria Workforce Management (WFM)] integration with Amazon Connect. During deployment, you can choose one or both of the following Alvaria WFM integration options:

* *Agent productivity*: This option enhances standard Amazon Connect reports with agent-productivity statistics including average positions staffed (APS) by agent group, available time by agent, unavailable time by agent, and sign-in/sign-out pairs by agent. You specify Alvaria WFM to treat Amazon Connect agent status labels (such as "break" or "project") as available, productive, signed-in, or signed-out. 
* *Alvaria Real-Time Adherence (RTA)*: Choose this option to provide information about Amazon Connect agent state changes to Alvaria RTA. Alvaria RTA monitors Amazon Connect agent adherence to schedules. 
Both integration options use a single Amazon Connect agent event stream. You can choose to deploy the solution with a new or existing https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html[Amazon Kinesis data stream] for this purpose. The deployment sizes the Kinesis data stream with a single shard. You can adjust the shard count for your agent event rate and number of consumers (agent productivity, Alvaria RTA, or custom agent-event readers).
