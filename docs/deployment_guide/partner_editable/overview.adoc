The Aspect Workforce integration with Amazon Connect deploys AWS objects required to support Amazon Connect ACD instances in Aspect Workforce. During deployment, you can choose one or both of the following integration options:

* *Agent Productivity*: This option enhances standard Amazon Connect reports with agent-productivity statistics including average positions staffed (APS), available time, unavailable time, and sign-in/sign-out pairs. You may configure how Amazon Connect agent status labels (such as "break" or "project") should be counted in Aspect Workforce, as available, productive, signed-in, or signed-out. 
* *Real-Time Adherence (RTA)*: Choose this option to provide information about Amazon Connect agent state changes to Aspect RTA. Aspect RTA monitors Amazon Connect agent adherence to schedules. 

Both integration options use a single Amazon Connect agent event stream. You can choose to deploy the solution with a new or existing https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html[Amazon Kinesis data stream] for this purpose. The deployment sizes the Kinesis data stream with a single shard. You can adjust the shard count for your agent event rate and number of consumers (agent productivity, RTA, or custom agent-event readers).
