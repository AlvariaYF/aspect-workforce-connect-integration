Deploying the *Agent Productivity integration* builds the following environment in the
AWS Cloud.

[#architecture1]
.Architecture for {partner-product-short-name} Agent Productivity integration on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram_1.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Agent Productivity integration sets up the following:

* Amazon Connect to provide an agent event Kinesis data stream.
* Amazon Connect to export scheduled reports to a configured Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.
* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for agent productivity data.
* Two Lambda functions:
** A Kinesis function to read agent events from your Amazon Connect instance and categorize them as spans of signed-in or signed-out time.
** An update function, invoked by an Amazon CloudWatch scheduled event, to write output objects to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose output stream. This ensures that the agent productivity S3 bucket is updated during periods of time when no agents are signed in.
* A Cloudwatch scheduled event to call the update Lambda function every five minutes. 
* A Kinesis Data Firehouse output stream to write the output of the Lambda functions to the agent productivity S3 bucket.
* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role to provide WFM Adapter with the following (not shown):
** Read-only access to the exported reports and agent productivity data S3 buckets.

Deploying *Real-Time Adherence integration* builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

As shown in <<architecture2>>, Real-Time Adherence integration sets up the following:

* Amazon Connect to write events to an agent event Kinesis data stream.
* A Kinesis Lambda function to read agent events form your Amazon Connect and then update an Amazon DynamoDB table and one or more Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues.
* A DynamoDB table to hold the latest state change for each agent signed into your Amazon Connect instance.  
* One or more SQS queues to relay Amazon Connect agent state changes to Real-Time Adherence (RTA).
* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role to provide RTA with the following (not shown):
** Read-only access to the DynamoDB table.
** Read/write access to the SQS queue.
** Access to update the configuration of the Lambda function.
