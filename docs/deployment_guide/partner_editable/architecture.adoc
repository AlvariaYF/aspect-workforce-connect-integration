image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram_1.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, agent productivity integration sets up the following:

* Amazon Connect to provide agent event stream read by a Kinesis AWS Lambda function.
* Two Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets: one to store exported reports, and another for agent productivity data.
* Two Lambda functions:
** A Kinesis function to read agent events from your Amazon Connect instance and categorize them as spans of signed-in or signed-out time.
** An update function, invoked by an Amazon CloudWatch scheduled event, to write output objects to an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose output stream. This ensures that the agent productivity S3 bucket is updated during periods of time when no agents are signed in.
* A Cloudwatch scheduled event to call the update Lambda function every five minutes. 
* A Kinesis Data Firehouse output stream to write the output of the Lambda functions to the agent productivity S3 bucket.

Deploying *Alvaria RTA integration* builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram_2.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture2>>, Alvaria RTA integration sets up the following:

* Amazon Connect to write events to an agent event data stream, which invokes an AWS Lambda function.
* A Lambda function, invoked by Amazon Connect, to update an Amazon DynamoDB table and Amazon SImple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.
* A DynamoDB table to hold the latest state change for each agent signed into your Amazon Connect instance.  
* An SQS queue to relay Amazon Connect agent state changes to Alvaria Real-Time Adherence (RTA).
* An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user to provide Alvaria RTA with the following (not shown):
** Read-only access to the DynamoDB table.
** Read/write access to the SQS queue.
** Access to update the configuration of the Lambda function.
